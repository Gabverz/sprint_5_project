# sprint_5_project
Repository to store and work on the project for Sprint 5 of the Data Science course of Tripleten.
This project's objective is to develop basic concepts of web-developing and intermediate python coding skills. 

This webpage shows two basic graphs of car selling ads in the US. In the first graph, you can see the distribution of the odometer indication of the cars, which means how much used the cars were during their lifetime. Secondly, there is a dispersion graph showing the relationship between car usage (referred as "Odometer") and the price, which clearly stablishes that less used cars have higher prices and vice-versa.
